            <h2>1 Nephi 17:3</h2>
            <p>And thus we see that the commandments of God must be fulfilled. And if it so be that the children of men
                keep the commandments of God he doth nourish them, and strengthen them, and provide means whereby they
                can accomplish the thing which he has commanded them; wherefore, he did provide means for us while we
                did sojourn in the wilderness.</p>

            <h2>Alma 32:42</h2>
            <p>And because of your diligence and your faith and your patience with the word in nourishing it, that it
                may take root in you, behold, by and by ye shall pluck the fruit thereof, which is most precious, which
                is sweet above all that is sweet, and which is white above all that is white, yea, and pure above all
                that is pure; and ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not, neither
                shall ye thirst.</p>
